We demonstrate that the 2017 U.S. Northern Great Plains (NGP) flash drought was preceded by a breakdown of land-atmosphere coupling. Severe drought conditions in the NGP were first identified by drought monitors in late May 2017 and rapidly progressed to exceptional drought in July. The likelihood of convective precipitation in May 2017 in northeastern Montana, however, resembled that of a typical August when rain is unlikely. Based on the lower tropospheric humidity index, convective rain was suppressed by the atmosphere on nearly 50% of days during March in NE Montana and central North Dakota, compared to 30% during a normal year. Micrometeorological variables, including potential evapotranspiration, were neither anomalously high nor low before the onset of drought. Incorporating convective likelihood to drought forecasts would have noted that convective precipitation in the NGP was anomalously unlikely during the early growing season of 2017. It may therefore be useful to do so in regions that rely on convective precipitation."5/31/18 6:56,Test,,Tester,whitneylonsdale@gmail.com,Montana Water Center,4065704318,,"502 N 9th Ave, Bozeman, MT 59715 US",Non-Student,No,No,Poster,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Testing registration,This is a test7/5/18 10:12,Luke,,Buckley,lbuckley@mtech.edu,Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology,(406) 496-4677,,"1300 W Park St, Butte, MT 59701 United States",Non-Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Surface Water Assessment and Monitoring Program (SWAMP) and the MBMG Data Center,"The Data Center at the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology (MBMG) is comprised of 50 databases and more than 40 web sites and applications. Each public-facing system (a database paired with a website) is designed to store and deliver information collected by researchers about Montanaâ€™s natural resources. Beginning with the Ground Water Information Center (GWIC) database in 1999, the MBMG has maintained an integrated online data presence. During the last 19 years, publicly available data have been published through either websites (e.g., GWIC, Catalog, Earthquakes, Abandoned Mines, Mapper), or GIS web services (e.g., Geothermal, GWIC, Abandoned Mines, Proppant, Earthquakes, Geology). As part of the MBMG data-integration philosophy, database reports contain the requested data as well as other available MBMG data for the request area.The newest addition to the Data Center is the Surface Water Assessment and Monitoring Program (SWAMP) database. After three years of concept development, the 2017 Montana Legislature officially created SWAMP as a new program. The database was populated initially by real-time and other existing data from MBMG and DNRC. Building on this initial effort, SWAMP is now incorporating data from other agencies and groups that collect surface-water data. Surface-water data (charts, statistics, and data downloads) are available through the SWAMP website (http://mbmg.mtech.edu/swamp) and can be viewed through a text- and map-based interface.The MBMG Data Center continues to increase in customer usage. The analytics and usage data for 2017 shows that more than 708,000 users hit the websites more than 33 million times and downloaded more than 6.1 billion pieces of data."7/7/18 16:25,Nolan,,Platt,nolanplatt4@gmail.com,Montana State University,(303) 731-9110,,"404 W Arthur St, Bozeman, MONTANA 59715 United States",Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,Yes,Ben,,Triano,Montana State University Dept.

This project is a collaboration between the Montana State University Departments of Ecology and Civil Engineering; other project partners include government organizations and private landowners.  An integrated approach consisting of â€œindirectâ€ù and â€œdirectâ€ù methods is utilized to determine factors that affect fish passage through Denils and model passage windows.  To directly evaluate fish passage, Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) experiments with wild fishes and hatchery grayling will be conducted to monitor fish movement through Denils.  The â€œindirectâ€ù method involves: gauging the hydrology of diversion sites, using HEC-RAS software to model hydraulic conditions around the diversion structure, and predicting fish passage windows over time based on known passage abilities.  The hydraulic models are coupled with laboratory passage data collected in 2016 to predict when the specific fishways are passable and inform managers about their benefits and limitations.  Design criteria and a design process for Denil fishways are proposed that maximizes the hydrologic conditions and times of year for which the ladder will work effectively.  Field work was conducted May-September 2017 and will continue April-October 2018 with results and a publication expected in Spring 2019.  Modelling Denil fishways using HEC-RAS, predicting passage windows, and designing Denils with hydrology in mind will be discussed in detail along with a summary of the project and the collaborative efforts that have made it possible."7/10/18 18:22,Kirk,B,Waren,kwaren@mtech.edu,Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology,(406) 496-4866,(406) 496-4155,"721 W Park St, Butte, MT 59701 United States",Non-Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,Yes,James,C,Rose,Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Groundwater Model for the Meadow Village Alluvial Aquifer, Big Sky, Gallatin County, Montana","Steady state and transient groundwater flow models are being developed to evaluate how groundwater pumping from the Meadow Village Aquifer in Big Sky, Montana affects the groundwater system and discharge rates in the West Fork Gallatin River. This aquifer, located beneath the Big Sky Golf Course, is the source for five municipal wells that provide water for the Big Sky Water and Sewer District, the primary public water supply for the resort. To construct the model, extensive groundwater and surface water data were collected from 2013-2016.  Drilling defined the geometry of the shale that underlies the alluvial aquifer. Groundwater elevations, stream flow and stage monitoring of the West Fork Gallatin River, local weather station data, well pumping volumes, and golf course irrigation data provided information to develop the conceptual model.

One common objective of this type of restoration is to increase seasonal water storage, which will in turn increase late-summer stream flows. However, the specific hydrologic mechanisms by which BMR would promote higher late summer flows remain poorly understood.We used GMS and MODFLOW to develop relatively simple numerical models of groundwater and surface water exchanges in fluvial systems, and assessed the magnitude and timing of changes in dynamic seasonal storage and stream flow resulting from BMR. Models were loosely based on headwater streams with a snowmelt-driven hydrograph and a valley gradient of about 0.005. Baseline models were developed for three different groundwater connection scenarios, where the simulated reach was gaining, losing, or strongly losing.  A control and five types of BMR treatments were simulated in each setting, including:  (1) no BMR, (2) creating a pond in the active channel, (3) activating a  proximal and a (4) distal remnant side-channel, (5) inundating the flood plain, and (6) creating surface water storage ponds connected to the channel only by groundwater flow paths. Thus, a total 18 of models were developed and used to calculate differences in net late-summer stream gains before and after restoration. Finally, sensitivity analyses using the baseline and distal channel reactivation scenarios in the gaining, losing and strongly losing settings evaluated the effects of substrate composition and evapotranspiration on the late-summer stream flow changes created by BMR.Active-channel ponds caused calculated late-summer net stream gains to increase by 0.06 Ls-1 (0.9 gpm) for the gaining stream, to increase by 0.07 Ls-1 (1.1 gpm) for the losing stream, and to decrease by 0.02 Ls-1 (0.3 gpm) for the strongly losing stream. Additional effects from activating remnant side-channels, or inundating the floodplain during high flows were modest, with the greatest gain being 0.01 Ls-1 (0.2 gpm) more than from the pond alone. Creating surface-water storage was more effective at increasing late-summer flows, with net stream gains increasing from 0.35 to 0.50 Ls-1 (5 to 8 gpm) above baseline. It should be noted that while these changes are calculable, they would be difficult to measure.Sensitivity analysis showed that aquifers composed of silty sand to coarse sand provided the best conditions for increasing late-summer flows. Similarly, stream beds composed of silty sand to sand provided for the greatest increase in late-summer flows. Simulation of evapotranspiration effects showed that the increase in groundwater table elevations (increased storage) created by BMR may allow more subsurface water to be used by riparian plants, potentially resulting in slight reductions in late-summer stream flow.In general, modeled scenarios suggest that BMR designs that recharge the aquifer farther from the channel lead to more seasonal storage. Creating seasonal storage in ponds that are connected to the main channel only through the subsurface strongly increases the potential for dynamic seasonal storage."7/11/18 17:25,Aaron,,Fiaschetti,afiaschetti@mt.gov,Montana DNRC,,,"1424 9th Ave, 1424 9th Ave, Helena, MT 59601 USA",Non-Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Confluence of Law and Science: A collaborative effort to manage water resources on the Teton River, Montana.","Over the last one hundred years, disputes have risen over the limited water resources of the Teton River.

Montanaâ€™s network design is based on aquifer extents and development, and provides current data about long-term trends in groundwater storage and quality. The systematic, long-term collection of data from the network can be useful to assess impacts caused by climatic conditions and land-use or development impacts.In 2017, a â€œflash droughtâ€ù gripped Montana brought on by sudden high temperatures and little rain. In less than three months conditions changed from â€˜Normalâ€™ to â€˜Exceptionalâ€™ â€“ the highest ranking on the drought scale. The rapid and intense onset of the drought after a relatively wet spring affected surface, or â€˜terrestrialâ€™ waterâ€”diminishing stream flows, drying up surface reservoirs, and depleting soil moisture.  Droughts tend to propagate through hydrologic systems with impacts to groundwater lagging behind surface water. Data from the state-wide groundwater monitoring network suggests that the drought did not propagate through to the groundwater system. The wet spring delivered groundwater recharge, and the large storage capacity appears to have â€˜bufferedâ€™ the groundwater system from the drought.Also in 2017, a paper analyzing more than 3.7 million water well records across the western United States concluded that â€œ1 in 30 wells constructed between 1950-2015 were likely dry during 2013-2015â€ù as a result of â€œunsustainable groundwater pumpingâ€_ depleting many western US aquifersâ€ù (Perrone and Jasechko, 2017).  Eight areas in Montana were identified as having a â€œhigh prevalence of dry wellsâ€ù (> 20%). A review of: 1) aquifers in the â€˜impactedâ€™ areas, 2) well records from the GWIC database, and 3) long-term groundwater water levels showed no evidence of declining water levels or dry wells. The study was an excellent compilation of a large dataset that helped raise awareness of groundwater dependence in the rural west, but made some overreaching conclusions.  The apparent change reported in the paper was not real in Montana and highlights the importance of direct observations to underpin big-data analyses."7/11/18 17:38,ALI,,GEBRIL,agebril@mtech.edu,Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology,,,,Non-Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Incorporating Geophysical Methods with Hydrogeologic Studies to Investigate Late-summer Dewatering in Lolo Creek, Southwest Missoula, Montana","Lolo Creek, a perennial major tributary to the Bitterroot River, has become intermittent in the lower reaches during some years. The  reasons for the  late summer dewatering has led to geophysical and hydrogeologic studies by the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology to understand the cause and effect relationship between surface water and groundwater uses, and stream flow. Lithology from boring logs, stream flow and groundwater level measurements, LiDAR and survey data, and geophysical information were used to construct a conceptual model for Lolo Creek study area. Geophysical measurements including Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Spontaneous Potential (SP), Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) and Seismic Refraction Tomography) were utilized to 1) delineate the saturated zones, 2) estimate depths to bedrock, 3) locate fractured bedrock zones, and 4) identify a geologic fault near the town of Lolo.  In addition, an empirical relationship was developed between aquifer hydraulic conductivity and electrical conductivity based on a field scale investigation. This relationship provided estimates of hydraulic conductivities at locations where aquifer properties were lacking.   Information obtained from geophysics studies are valuable to confirm hydrogeologic framework and the conceptual model. A sound conceptual model is vital to build a robust groundwater flow model that we intend to use as an investigation tool to study the impacts on Lolo Creek late-summer flow due to changes in irrigation practices, water consumption, climate change, and variation in boundary conditions, e.g. changes in Bitterroot River elevation . The results of this investigation will help guide water management decisions and restoration efforts in the Lolo Creek watershed."7/12/18 11:31,Kimberly,,Bray,kimberly.bray@umontana.edu,University of Montana,,,"32 Campus Drive HS 104, Missoula, Montana 59812 United States",Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,Yes,Marc,,Peipoch,Stroud Water Research Center,H.

Elevated concentrations of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in the Upper Clark Fork River (UCFR) of MT promote extensive mid-summer blooms of green algae (i.e. Cladophora), with some evidence of late-summer cyanobacteria proliferation. In addition to nutrient loading, the UCFR suffers from major metal contamination. Algal form and abundance may play a critical role in metal movement through the food web. Research addressing N availability, the relative abundance of N-fixing cyanobacteria and Cladophora in the periphyton community, and their interactions was addressed to determine the implications of nutrient enrichment. Summer-long assessment of N- fixation rates revealed fluxes ranging from 0.7 to 45.4 ugNm-2h-1 while biofilm abundance varied by almost 80-fold (0.456  to 36.1 g AFDM/m2) over six weeks of sampling.

In this way, instream wood can alter channel morphology at multiple spatial scales, with implications for fish habitat, flooding, and carbon storage. The distribution and geomorphic impact of large wood within transitional or mixed bedrock-alluvial channels are poorly understood. This project investigated the relationship between large wood and sediment routing in mixed bedrock-alluvial, snowmelt-dominated mountain streams. Within a representative stream reach in the Bitterroot Mountains in southwestern Montana, we measured and characterized large wood, and surveyed the volume of associated sediment. One-dimensional hydraulic and sediment transport modeling provides context for field measurements. Total storage of wood and sediment correlates with channel type and associated hydraulics. The upper portion of the study reach is predominantly alluvial while the lower portion is best described as mixed bedrock-alluvial due to significant bedrock exposure along the channel bed and banks. The latter contains half the volume of wood and one-third the volume of sediment measured in the alluvial subreach. Hydraulic modeling suggests that shear stress, which is driven by channel slope, is about five times greater in the mixed bedrock-alluvial subreach. Together, these results suggest that channel type, and associated transport capacity of large wood and sediment, may partly account for observed differences in wood load and its geomorphic impact. This research builds upon existing frameworks describing the complex interactions between wood and sediment in addressing an important gap within our understanding of sediment connectivity in forested mountain streams."7/13/18 9:55,Mauricio,,Larenas,admin@sourcemolecular.com,Source Molecular Corp.,,,"4985 SW 74th Court, Miami, Florida 33155 United States",Non-Student,Yes,No,Oral Presentation,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Leveraging DNA to Identify Sources of Fecal Pollution in Stormwater,"Protecting public health from the serious risks posed by fecal pollution in the water is a concern by government officials, especially elected officers. Stormwater managers face increasing pressure to keep waters clean from untreated discharges. But traditional methods used to monitor water quality are ineffective at distinguishing between sources. Source identification is necessary to mitigate the problem. Too often, water managers equate fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) with disease-causing bacteria. Most of these FIBs are considered harmless and can sometimes even originate from non-fecal sources. Bacteria sources need to be identified in order to determine whether they are pathogenic. Pathogenic bacteria are what causes people to get skin rashes when they swim in polluted waters. Ingesting them also cause serious illnesses that would land people in the hospital. Bacteria in urban stormwater usually have multiple sources such as humans, dogs, birds and cattle from peri-urban lands. DNA is the gold standard in industries such as forensic science. Genetic technology is being applied to water quality monitoring to identify bacteria sources. Microbial Source Tracking (MST), a DNA-based test method, helps stormwater managers determine where fecal pollution is coming from, pinpoint the host responsible for the fecal pollution, and evaluate BMP effectiveness.   The presentation includes a discussion on two MST projects in Massachusetts and California. Geosyntec conducted a project for the Boston Water and Sewer Commission in which they used DNA markers to assess the effectiveness of Boston's MS4 IDDE program in storm water and other water systems. Santa Barbara in California used MST to identify host fecal contamination sources that polluted their beaches through storm water systems. A follow-up MST study was conducted by Santa Barbara to evaluate the impact of the structural and non-structural best management practices (BMPs) deployed to mitigate this fecal pollution."7/13/18 10:14,Chris,A,Ellison,cellison@usgs.gov,US Geological Survey,(406) 457-5901,(406) 457-5990,"3162 Bozeman Ave, Helena, Montana 59601 USA",Non-Student,No,Yes,Oral Presentation,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Application of Dimensionless Sediment Rating Curves to Predict Suspended-Sediment Concentrations, Bedload, and Annual Sediment Loads for Rivers and Streams","Consistent and reliable sediment data are needed by Federal, State, and local government agencies responsible for monitoring water quality, planning river restoration, quantiÂ¬fying sediment budgets, and evaluating the effectiveness of sediment reduction strategies. Heightened concerns about excessive sediment in rivers and the challenge to reduce costs and eliminate data gaps has guided Federal and State interests in pursuing alternative methods for measuring suspended and bedload sediment. Simple and dependable data collection and estimation techniques are needed to generate hydraulic and water-quality information for areas where data are unavailable or difficult to collect. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, completed a study to evaluÂ¬ate the use of dimensionless sediment rating curves (DSRCs) to accurately predict suspended-sediment concentrations (SSCs), bedload, and annual sediment loads for selected rivers and streams in Minnesota based on data collected during 2007 through 2013. Multiple measures of goodness-of-fit were developed to assess the effectiveness of DSRC models in predicting SSC and bedload for rivers in Minnesota. More than 600 dimensionless ratio values of SSC, bedload, and streamflow were evaluated and delineated according to Pfankuch stream stability categories of â€œgood/fairâ€ù and â€œpoorâ€ù to develop four Minnesota-based DSRC models. The basis for DSRC model effectiveness was founded on measures of goodness-of-fit that included proximity of the model(s) fitted line to the 95-percent confidence intervals of the site-specific model, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values, model biases, and deviation of annual sediment loads from each model to the annual sediment loads calculated from measured data.The Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values for the MinÂ¬nesota DSRC model for suspended-sediment concentrations closely matched Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of the site-specific regression models for 12 out of 16 sites. For predicting annual suspended-sediment loads (SSL), the Minnesota DSRC models for good/fair and poor stream stability sites closely approximated the annual SSLs calculated from the measured data. Practitioners are cautioned that DSRC reliability is dependent on representative measures of bankfull streamflow, SSC, and bedload. Samples of SSC and bedload, which will be used for estimating SSC and bedload at the bankfull streamflow, should be collected over a range of conditions that includes the ascending and descending limbs of the hydrograph. DSRC models should not be used to predict SSC and sediment loads for extreme streamflows, such as those that exceed twice the bankfull streamflow value. Applying these methods, Montana-based DSRCs can be developed using existing sediment data from the USGS coupled with minimum numbers of samples to fill in data gaps. Using these methods, environmental groups, conservation districts, state agencies, tribes and other interested entities in Montana can apply DSRCs for the purpose of stream restoration planning and design, and for estimating annual sediment loads for streams where little or no sediment data are available."7/13/18 11:25,David,L,Naftz,dlnaftz@usgs.gov,USGS,(406) 457-5945,,"3162 Bozeman Ave., Helena, MT 59601 USA",Non-Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,Yes,Elliott,PP,Barnhart,USGS,Jason,,Gildea,USEPA,Craig,,Stricker,USGS,Travis,,Schmidt,USGS,Mike,,Ruggles,MT FWP,Kent,,Easthouse,Army Corps of Engineers,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Non-resident selenium imports to Lake Koocanusa and Bighorn Lake, MT: Sources, biogeochemical cycling, and tailwater implications",**Abstract submitted to Nancy Hystad on 7/13/18 at 09:30 for input**7/13/18 11:58,Robert,,Rader,rrader@mtech.edu,"Department of Geological Engineering, Montana Tech",,,"1300 West Park Street, Butte, MT 59701 USA",Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,Yes,Chris,,Gammons,"Department of Geological Engineering, Montana Tech",Richelle,,Carney,"Department of Geological Engineering, Montana Tech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Geochemistry of metals and nutrients in fine-sediment pore water in Blacktail and Silver Bow creeks, Butte, Montana","Historical mining activities in Butte, Montana have impacted surface and groundwater in the area. Contaminants of concern (COCs) include copper, lead, zinc, cadmium, and arsenic. Although most of the known sources of COCs have been removed or remediated, there is evidence from synoptic sampling by previous workers that metal loading continues to occur in lower Blacktail Creek and upper Silver Bow Creek during baseflow conditions. One possible source for this metal loading is upwelling groundwater. Another possible source is interaction between the stream and fine-grained, metal-rich sediment in the stream bed. To assess the importance of fine sediment as a source (or sink) for metals, this investigation is using sediment pore-water diffusion samplers (â€œpeepersâ€ù). Peepers are ideal for capturing cm-scale vertical gradients in pore-water chemistry in the top 20â€“25 cm of the sediment column. To date, we have deployed three peepers in lower Blacktail Creek, two peepers in the â€œslag canyonâ€ù of upper Silver Bow Creek, and two peepers in shallow ponds on either side of lower Blacktail Creek. Pore-water samples extracted from the peepers were analyzed for dissolved trace metals, major ions, and selected nutrients. Sediment samples collected at each peeper site were analyzed by XRD and portable XRF. Our preliminary data show steady increases in the concentration of dissolved iron, manganese, arsenic, soluble reactive phosphorus, ammonium, and bicarbonate ion with depth in the shallow sediment. These changes are attributed to reductive dissolution of Fe- and Mn-oxides, coupled to organic matter decay, in the anoxic environment of the fine-grained sediment. Copper and zinc behave differently, and generally have very low values in the deeper samples. However, in some cases, there is a zone where dissolved Cu and Zn concentrations pass through a maximum in the top 2â€“6 cm of the sediment column and decrease to ppb levels at greater depth. Concentrations of Zn can get especially high in this top zone (e.g., > 10 mg/L). Our hypothesis is that the fine â€œmuckyâ€ù sediment is a sink for Cu and Zn in the form of insoluble metal sulfides as long as conditions are anoxic. However, near the top of the sediment column, advection and/or diffusion of dissolved oxygen from the overlying stream causes oxidation of the Cu-Zn sulfides and release of metals back into the sediment pore water. Once mobilized, the metals can then diffuse upwards into the stream.   This project is being funded through the Butte Natural Resource Damages Program (NRDP). Our peeper sampling and data interpretation will continue through the summer and fall of 2018 and a synthesis of results will be reported at the AWRA conference."7/13/18 13:37,Paul,,Stoy,paul.stoy@montana.edu,Montana State University,(406) 600-3577,,,Non-Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,Yes,Gabriel,,Bromley,Montana State University,Tobias,,Gerken,Montana State University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Convective suppression before and during the flash drought of 2017,"Flash droughts tend to be disproportionately destructive because they intensify rapidly and are difficult to prepare for.

This tributary supports an isolated population of Yellowstone cutthroat trout, a USFS regionally listed sensitive species. Drilling would require water withdrawal from the stream at multiple locations. Given the regulatory requirements for maintenance of in-stream flows and the importance of maintaining aquatic habitat integrity, there is a need to evaluate and mitigate the effects on aquatic ecosystems resulting from water withdrawals.In effort to address these concerns, in 2017 a collaborative monitoring effort was undertaken by the CGNF and Sibanye Stillwater Mining Company (SSMC). The Wetted Perimeter Method (sensu Nelson 1984; also Annear and Conder 1984; Lohr 1993; California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife 2013) was used to assess potential impacts from water withdrawals on aquatic habitat. A series of pressure transducers were deployed in tandem with staff gages in close proximity to proposed water withdrawal sites. Discharge and staff gage measurements were completed periodically through the field season.  Subsequent data analysis linked transducer measurements with on-the-ground validation data to infer stage-discharge and discharge-wetted perimeter relationships. These measurements and relationships were evaluated against proposed withdrawal rates to discern potential drawdown and implications on aquatic habitat.The flow monitoring methodology implemented during the 2017 field season, for the most part, adequately captured flow variability and stage dynamics while instrumentation was in place.  Collected data suggested that even without water withdrawals, the majority of flows during the monitoring period (July-September) fell below levels generally corresponding with optimum macroinvertebrate habitat availability but above levels where macroinvertebrate habitat availability tends to steeply decline.  Aquatic habitat was deemed unlikely to be affected by drafting operations at all but one reach. Collected data and associated analyses were used to develop guidelines for water withdrawal rates during exploratory drilling.Though this monitoring effort demonstrated the informative power of one season of data collection combined with thorough data analysis, there is a strong need to gather and process more data to validate the conclusions drawn from the 2017 monitoring year. Monitoring will continue through the 2019 field season."7/13/18 15:04,John,N,Babcock,jbabcock@waterenvtech.com,Water & Environmental Technologies,(406) 497-8682,(406) 723-1537,"480 East Park St., Butte, MT 59701 USA",Non-Student,No,Yes,Oral Presentation,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Little Bitterroot Lake Association - 20 Years of,"The Little Bitterroot Lake Association was formed in 1988 with the purpose of preserving the recreational value of Little Bitterroot Lake, maintaining its aesthetic integrity, and to educate users about the value of the lake as a recreational resource.

In Montana, an SMZs law regulates commercial forestry activities, and requires timber buffer be retained within 15 m of streams, with a steep-slope ground-based equipment exclusion area that can extend up to 30 m.  The amount of timber removal in the SMZ is a function of the pre-harvest tree size and stocking, with removals of 0-30% typical. The effectiveness of SMZs for stream temperature control in Montana has not been previously evaluated.  Between 1999 and 2004, half-hourly stream temperature data were collected at 30 operational harvest sites bordering perennial fish-bearing streams in western Montana.  Temperature data were collected at the upper and lower boundary of the harvest, for a minimum of one summer before and after harvest.  A variety of covariate data were collected to describe the harvest, and fish data were also collected.  The response measures were analyzed using a linear mixed effects model.  No significant harvest effect was found for the six evaluated temperature metrics, with estimates between -0.1 and 0.04 degrees C.  Fish population and biomass also had no significant harvest effect.

Along the wetland-stream continuum, hydrogeomorphic and biologic conditions influence nutrient processing at various scales and affect the magnitude, processing efficiency, and fate of nutrients. Ultimately, the interaction of various processes among linked aquatic systems determines loads to receiving waters by dictating net nutrient export form and abundance. Using a mass-balance approach, we developed biogeochemical and hydrologic budgets in a tributary landscape of the Upper Clark Fork River (UCFR) to better understand its substantial influence on nutrient loads to a river undergoing extensive restoration. We measured hydrologic discharge and nutrient concentrations along 22 km to develop budgets that characterized reaches by nutrient production, transformation, and retention. Variable groundwater, hydrogeomorphic, and biologic conditions differentiated reaches along the continuum and identified key drivers of nutrient processing through space and time. We found large disparities in nutrient production and retention rates between wetland- and stream-dominated reaches and identified hydrologic residence time and groundwater inputs as controls of nutrient loads to receiving waters. Spatial variability of biogeochemical processing was primarily driven by hydraulic conditions, while temporal variability was related to seasonal shifts in biologic activity and hydrologic discharge."7/13/18 15:58,Chuck,E,Dalby,cdalby@mt.gov,DNRC Water Resources,(406) 444-6644,,"1424 9th ave, P.O. 201601, Helena, MT 59620 USA",Non-Student,Yes,No,Oral Presentation,Yes,Troy,,Blandford,Montana State Library,Bill,,Greiman,DNRC Water Resources (retd.),Gerry,,Daumiller,Montana State Library (retd.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Comparison of  Satellite-Based,  Remote-Sensing Methods for Estimating Evapotranspiration from Irrigated Land in the Flathead and Smith River Basins of Montana.","Evapotranspiration (ET), a significant part of the annual water balance of most watersheds in Montana, is difficult to reliably estimate at spatial and temporal scales useful for water planning and management.

With support from the DNRC RDG Program, Ninemile Creek and its associated floodplain and tributary connections are being reclaimed through restoring the stream to a natural channel configuration, regrading placer tail piles and dredge ponds, and reconnecting tributary confluences.   Contaminant Cleanup and Wetland Restoration at the Harlowton Roundhouse â€“ City of Harlowton Historic fueling operations at an abandoned Milwaukee Roundhouse in Harlowton, Montana released diesel fuel to soil and groundwater in the floodplain of the Musselshell River.  Diesel contamination has impacted approximately 25,000 cubic yards of soil and free-phase diesel is present on the groundwater surface over approximately 2 acres of the site.    With support from the DNRC RDG and RRGL programs, the City of Harlowton will remove contaminated soils and design a restored wetland that the City plans to turn into a park. Vaughn Wastewater System Improvement Project â€“ Vaughn Cascade County Water Sewer DistrictThe Vaughn Cascade County Water and Sewer District wastewater system currently has 259 year-round sewer connections.

CREWS expands Montanaâ€™s research capacity to address water-related issues stemming from land-resource use impacts including hard rock mining, intensive agriculture, and energy extraction. A convergent research approach integrates faculty and students from four teams: 1) systems ecology and earth sciences; 2) molecular engineering and environmental science; 3) environmental synoptic signals and sensors; and 4) natural resource social sciences to respond to nationally relevant water quality problems. To do this, the project focuses on three exemplary study-sites: 1) hard rock mining in the Upper Clark Fork River; 2) agriculture and grazing in the Judith Basin; and 3) energy extraction in the Powder River Basin. A unified research theme addresses the origin, persistence and transformation of contaminants in water, and their impact on ecological and social systems. CREWS builds sustainable research competitiveness and infrastructure by establishing collaborative programs among three Montana University System (MUS) research institutions, two tribal colleges, the private sector, and state government. CREWS integrates interdisciplinary research activities and outcomes to STEM education, inclusion, professional development, commercialization, and partnerships to build the research and education enterprise. The project will focus on 1) how heavy metals and N enrichment alter aquatic ecosystems, and how nutrients and metals act as subsidies and stressors in the context of river productivity, algal blooms, and ecology; 2) how high levels of nitrate nitrate interact with organic pesticides in ground water derived from dryland agriculture and quantification of the mechanism by which intensive agriculture interacts with natural hydrologic dynamics to control nitrate and applied organics in soil, riparian, and stream systems; and 3) the origin, persistence and transformation of sulfate to measure how actions associated with energy development alter surface-groundwater exchange. Mechanistic studies in the biophysical domain link to capstone research on stakeholder and community response to contaminants in water systems and the viability of technological solutions.

Wastewater effluent represents a critical point source of both metal and nutrient contaminants to aquatic ecosystems, with wastewater lagoons serving as the most common wastewater treatment system in the rural United States. While metal and nutrient contaminants have historically been considered to be either â€œparticulateâ€ù and unavailable if they are retained by a 450 nm filter, or â€œdissolvedâ€ù and bioavailable if they pass through. Recent work has suggested that these operational definitions may be inadequate as there is a continuum of sizes below 450 nm including small stable particles of all sizes and compositions (small colloids), as well as truly dissolved solutes (< 1 nm). Additionally, emerging research has shown that the uptake of small-colloids can rival or exceed that of truly dissolved solutes in some organisms. By improving our understanding of the distribution of elements among size fractions in wastewater effluent we can begin to examine how this drives organismal impacts of increased contributions of wastewater to surface flows. It may also help to inform inexpensive management options to enhance lagoon efficacy. To characterize the distribution of metals, N, and P across size fractions in wastewater lagoons, we collected water from six lagoon systems in the Montanaâ€™s Clark Fork River Watershed. Water samples were filtered allowing us to quantify metals, N, and P in the >450 nm, 1-450 nm, and < 1 nm size classes. We found that Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Co, Zn, Al, Pb, Se, and As tended to be enriched in the 1-450 nm size range by up to a factor of 10, while Ni, V, and Cd were enriched in the < 1 nm fraction. These results suggest that wastewater lagoons serve as a source of both colloidal and truly dissolved contaminants. Next steps will examine how the association of elements in these different size fractions influences the accumulation of these elements by organisms in these systems and receiving waters."7/13/18 20:32,Andrew,M,Ray,andrew_ray@nps.gov,National Park Service Greater Yellowstone Netowrk,(406) 994-7498,,"2327 University Way, Suite 2, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA",Non-Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,Yes,Tom,,Henderson,Montana Department of Environmental Quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Collaborative Science: A Case Study on Mine Reclamation Activities to Improve Ecological Health of Yellowstoneâ€™s Soda Butte Creek,"Collaborative water resource science is a cooperative process in which interested parties work by integrating data and sharing information in order to seek solutions and achieve a common goal. Collaboration involves sharing resources and information, as well as, risks and rewards. It promotes innovation, mutual learning, and expanded possibilities. Ultimately, collaborative water resource science is an opportunity to improve scientific understanding to inform decision-making. The reclamation of the McLaren Tailings site and assessment of water quality in Soda Butte Creek over the past two decades represents a unique and highly successful collaborative effort between stakeholder groups and multiple state and federal agencies. Nearly 25 years ago, researchers described a layer of unusual bright orange sediments on the floodplain of lower reaches of Soda Butte Creek just upstream of the confluence with the Lamar River inside Yellowstone National Park (YNP). These discolored sediments were traced nearly 15 miles upstream and outside YNP to the abandoned McLaren Mill and Tailings Impoundment located near Cooke City, Montana. Abandoned in the 1950s, the mill was gone but the failing tailings impoundment remained covering the Soda Butte Creek channel and negatively impacting fisheries downstream. The segment of Soda Butte Creek below the McLaren site and downstream to the Montana-Wyoming border was later identified as a Clean Water Act-impaired water body; the only impaired water body entering YNP. In collaboration with National Park Service (NPS) scientists, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) developed the site reclamation plan in 2008-2009, and completed the reclamation work over a five-year period from 2010 through 2014. The 22 million dollar project included excavation and treatment of nearly one half million tons of mine tailings, and the operation of a water treatment system. Following reclamation, the NPS and DEQ conducted water quality sampling throughout the upper Soda Butte watershed. This contemporary monitoring data and subsequent analyses led to a determination by the DEQ Water Quality Bureau that metal conditions in Soda Butte Creek now meet state water quality standards. The EPA concurred with this recommendation and Soda Butte Creek has since been removed from the Montanaâ€™s 2018 Integrated Water Quality Report. In this presentation we will discuss ongoing collaborative monitoring activities to investigate remaining metal sources in the watershed and share strategies to integrate historic and contemporary datasets to assess the recovery of ecological health. This case study highlights how a cross-organizational team can work collaboratively to achieve shared goals and successfully support a water resource determination.

Interactions controlling soil water and nitrate loss in a non-irrigated cropping system","In dryland cropping systems, evaporation and recharge of groundwater via deep percolation below the root zone are typically considered inefficiencies in precipitation use that contribute to the gap between actual and potential crop yield. Deep percolation also transports nitrate from soils to groundwater, which reduces nitrogen use efficiency and can threaten groundwater quality. Chemical fallow is a common practice in central Montana, where vegetation growth is suppressed for a full year with herbicide, in order to store soil water for the subsequent crop and reduce agronomic risk. A common cereal production rotation in the Judith River Watershed of Central Montana is crop-crop-fallow (e.g., winter wheat â€“ spring grain â€“ fallow), which means approximately one third of cultivated land is likely to be in fallow during any given year. The effect of fallow on precipitation partitioning between crop use, evaporation, and groundwater recharge has been quantified in a limited number of studies and even less frequently as it interacts with soil characteristics to influence groundwater quality. Understanding how weather, soils, and fallow management interact to determine deep percolation and nitrate leaching is critical to make informed decisions to increase agricultural sustainability and mitigate environmental degradation. We present the results of simulations of vertical water movement with the Hydrus 1D soil water model to explore the hydrologic influence of fallow practices in different scenarios of weather and soil thickness. Atmospheric boundary conditions for the model were adapted from the Agrimet station at the Central Agricultural Research Center at Moccasin and from meteorological observations at the study fields. The model was calibrated by adjusting Van Genuchten soil hydraulic parameters until they produce simulations that match observations of soil moisture measured on the study fields in 2013-2014. Nitrate leaching losses were estimated by coupling modeled deep percolation with observed lysimeters concentrations between 2013-2016. During cropped years following fallow years, lysimeter nitrate concentrations are significantly higher relative to fallow years or sequential cropped years. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that nitrate concentrations in soils are primarily determined by nitrate inputs from mineralization of soil organic matter (high in fallow years) and fertilizer additions (occurring in cropped years). Simulations suggest that fallow years tend to have the highest deep percolation rates, and cropped years following fallow have only slightly higher deep percolation rates than cropped years following crop. The interaction of influences of fallow on nitrate concentrations and deep percolation resulted in the highest nitrate leaching rates during fallow years. Furthermore, nitrate leaching rates in cropped years following fallow are notably higher than in cropped years following crop, due primarily to elevated soil water nitrate concentrations after the fallow year.

ZodrowEnvironmental Engineering Department - Montana Technological UniversityOver the years, technologies have been developed for water treatment, including membrane filtration processes, such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis. Biofouling, the growth of biofilms on membrane filtration processes is a type of fouling that is a result of microorganisms that adhere to surfaces and produces slimy extracellular polymeric substances. These biofilms have high resistance to biocides, making them one of the most successful forms of life on earth.  Biofilm formation on membranes results in shorter membrane life, more frequent membrane cleaning, higher operating pressure and lower water quality.Mitigation methods such as feed water pretreatment and application of disinfectants are not effective since features of bacteria such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in which bacteria are embedded make them resistant to biocides. Thus, prevention is a better technique, and membrane modifications that prevent biofilm formation are being explored.Several techniques for membrane surface modification including surfactants, chemical grafting, polymer blends, coatings, and plasma have been developed. This research aims at modifying the surface of a reverse osmosis membrane using nisin-coated silica particles to mitigate biofouling in water treatment. Nisin is a food safe antimicrobial compound produced from Lactococcus lactis. It is commonly used as a food preservative in food processing. It binds to the cell wall of bacteria and disrupts cell wall production thus, it is useful for biofouling mitigation.This project focuses on synthesizing and characterizing silica particles modified with nisin. Silica particles were produced using the Stober and Fink method, and the particles were subsequently covalently bound to nisin. Bacillus subtilis, an important biofilm-forming bacteria, was used for toxicity tests, and the results show the silica particles modified with nisin are toxic to the bacteria. The zeta sizer was used for the particle size distribution test, and the measurement showed that the diameter of the silica particles is 35.30 nm. The diameter of the silica particles increases when modified with nisin, and a tri-modal particle size distribution was produced with particle size distributions of 788.5 nm, 158.9 nm, and 5204 nm. Also, the zeta potential obtained using the zeta sizer shows Si-nisin particles have positive charge at relevant pH. These particles will be covalently bound to a reverse osmosis membrane and tested at bench-scale to determine their biofilm prevention potential."7/13/18 22:54,Katherine,R,Zodrow,kzodrow@mtech.edu,Montana Tech,(496) 412-0,,"1300 W Park St, Butte, MT 59701 USA",Non-Student,Yes,Yes,Oral Presentation,Yes,Grant,,Myhre,Montana Tech,Ross,,Monasmith,,Ryan,,Moe,Montana Tech,Jared,,Geer,Montana Tech,Courtney,,Young,Montana Tech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Passive Evaporation Enhancement of Acidic Mine Water,"Evaporation is an important component of water balances in mining operations, and mines often utilize evaporation to reduce volumes of liquid mine wastes. In this project, we developed a material that can float on evaporation ponds and enhance evaporation rates. The hydrophilic, photothermal material wicks water up its sides. Then, the material absorbs light, heats up, and evaporates the water. This collaborative project is the result of two senior design teams including students in Environmental Engineering and Metallurgical Engineering at Montana Tech. High density polyethylene canisters were coated with a variety of materialsâ€”activated carbon (of different sizes), fiberglass, and activated carbon air filters. While the baseline evaporation rate in our bench-scale setup was ~30 g/h, the addition of uncoated canisters lowered the evaporation rate to ~16 g/h. Indeed, this phenomenon is one reason balls or canisters that could deter birds are not used on ponds where evaporation is needed to reduce water volumes. However, a coating of carbon black increased the evaporation rate to ~47 g/h, a 57% increase over the baseline evaporation rate.The evaporation rate is a result of the materialsâ€™ light absorbance and affinity for water. Thus, the material properties were observed using scanning electron microscopy, contact angle goniometry, thermogravimetric analysis, and UV-vis reflectance. These analyses were complimented by a water chemistry and precipitation analysis using STABCAL and observation of scalants formed during submersion of the material in water from Horseshoe Bend, a mine-impacted stream in Butte Montana. The thorough analysis of material properties and their correlation with evaporation rates will assist in further development of materials that enhance evaporation rates."7/13/18 23:05,Ngaio,L,Richards,ngaio@wd4c.org,Working Dogs for Conservation (WD4C),(406) 529-0384,,"14560 Thayer Road, Lolo, Montana 59847 United States",Non-Student,No,No,Oral Presentation,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Using Detection Dogs to Monitor Environmental Contaminants in Freshwater Ecosystems Via Sentinel Species,"Various types of environmental contaminants are introduced into freshwater ecosystems through anthropogenic inputs. Preliminary investigations focusing on exposure in organisms high atop the food chain (e.g., piscivores) can yield data complimentary to water quality monitoring efforts and inform more targeted follow-up studies. Both apex predators, River otter and American mink are worthy sentinel species, however they are also notoriously elusive which can make sampling difficult. Fortunately, their fecal matter can be collected non-invasively for screening of environmental contaminants and genetics analyses. Between 2013 and 2015, Working Dogs for Conservation (WD4C) led a study to determine the feasibility of incorporating detection dogs in efforts to monitor and safeguard the health of freshwater ecosystems and their inhabitants. To maximize the number of viable fecal samples recovered for analysis, specially trained conservation detection dogs (aka â€˜scat detection dogsâ€™) paired with professional handlers - themselves biologists â€“ surveyed along five rivers in Montana and collected otter and mink fecal matter for analysis of heavy metals, anthropogenic organic contaminants (AOCs) including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and polybrominated (PBDE) flame retardants as well as for genetics analyses. Performance comparisons between dog-handler teams and experienced surveyors were conducted for perspective on fecal matter find rates. Overall, dog-handler team surveys yielded more fecal samples for considerably less search effort and all three focal contaminants were detectible in these samples. This presentation discusses our survey and analytical findings, describes the analytical methods and capacity developed specifically for this project and to enable further work to go forward, and provides recommendations for follow-up investigations, based on lessons learned."7/14/18 0:17,John,,Allard,john.allard@umwestern.edu,University of Montana Western,,,"710 S Atlantic Ave, Dillon, MT 59725 United States",Student,No,No,Poster,Yes,Sharon,,Williams,University of Montana Western,Rebekah,,Levine,University of Montana Western,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Using sediment maps to understand fluvial sediment dynamics associated with in-channel, deformable structures","In the snowmelt dominated watersheds of southwest Montana, channel incision is disconnecting streams from floodplains and reducing associated riparian habitat. Incision can also result in: 1) loss of meandering, thus increasing velocity and decreasing aggradation 2) lowered channel and water table elevation 3) bank instability and increased sediment loads 4) increased water temperatures from vegetation loss. Installation of structures that intentionally alter fluvial processes has been successful in reconnecting channels to floodplains. Channel elevating riffle-grade-control-structures (RGCS) were installed by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and partners on Long Creek in the Centennial Valley of southwest Montana in late August of 2016. Brush structures, built primarily from on-site materials such as conifer and willow, were installed along Robb Creek, a tributary of the Ruby River in southwest Montana, in 2015 and 2017. The goal of RGCSs and brush structures is to create riffle-pool morphology, encouraging sediment storage upstream and increased velocity downstream, ultimately promoting aggradation through induced meanders and re-establishing floodplain connectivity. Broader floodplains and aggrading channels promote longer water residence times, thus increasing infiltration and potentially increasing alluvial aquifer storage. Ultimately, the hydrological shifts have the potential to enhance late summer discharge. The University of Montana Westernâ€™s 2017 Hydrology Course used base maps of stream banklines overlain by 2 x 2 m grids to map sediment patches. Each patch was classified into a sediment class and the entire stream bottom was mapped where possible. Sedimentation patterns from maps are being used to determine how RGCSs are impacting channel morphology and hydrologic function. On Long Creek, we compared mapped sediments to pre-installation data from one year prior. We found an increase in fine sediments and aquatic vegetation in the channel, and an areal reduction in gravel. On Robb Creek, our mapping provided pre-installation baseline data to asses impacts of the brush structures installed during, and following, our project work."7/14/18 0:42,Lydia,,Landau,lydia.landau@umwestern.edu,University of Montana Western,,,"710 S Atlantic Ave, Dillon, MT 59725 United States",Student,No,No,Poster,Yes,Sharon,,Williams,University of Montana Western,John,,Allard,University of Montana Western,Rebekah,,Levine,University of Montana Western,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pre-restoration characteristics of high elevation mesic sites in greater sage-grouse habitats,"Successful greater sage-grouse rearing habitat has been found in association with intermediate moisture regime meadows (mesic meadows) that are adjacent to wetter, riparian areas and intermittent colluvial channels fed by high elevation snow patches. Mesic meadows and associated moisture regimes, however, are being impacted by incision of channels and earlier runoff. In order to increase soil moisture, expand mesic vegetation, enhance the abundance of forbs and insects for sage-grouse broods and songbird populations, local and federal agencies are attempting to restore mesic meadows in sage-grouse brood rearing areas. The restoration work is occurring across sagebrush types, but all projects are focused on mesic meadows, seeps and first-order streams. Part of the restoration will include installation of rock and brush structures to spread and slow water as well as structures that will inhibit incision and loss of wet and mesic meadow area. Limited data, however, exist to inform placement of structures, particularly in high-elevation, snow-melt dominated, mountain big sagebrush basins. Our goal was to develop an initial understanding of soil characteristics, underlying geology, and snowpack of the selected restoration sites in southwest Montana. We worked at two project sites collecting on-the-ground observations of landscape variability as well as spring and channel locations. We also assessed degradation and restoration potential across the sites and found that slope morphology was an important characteristics affecting the potential for meadow degradation. Additionally, soil reports, geologic maps, and satellite images of persistent snowpack were compiled and analyzed for each site. At the studied sites, geology and aspect are important controls on site potential for late season persistence of water. We also recommend additional remote sensing work to assess snowpack.

Recent work looking at the ecosystem impacts of silver nanoparticles as an emerging contaminant indicated that such contaminants could tilt the balance toward enhanced methane release, though questions remained as to the mechanisms driving this phenomenon and its generalizability to real-world scenarios given that reported observations were from experiments using onetime high-concentration additions of zero-valent silver nanoparticles (Ag0-NPs) while real world releases are likely to be chronic low-concentration additions of weathered and less toxic silver sulfide nanoparticles (Ag2S-NPs). To examine the underlying mechanisms, a microcosm study was conducted with microcosms containing sediment, sediment and submersed vegetation, submersed vegetation, or just water with or without Ag0-NPs to examine the role of plant derived DOC, and whether changes in methane production or consumption were the likely drivers. To test the impacts of the rate of addition or form of silver nanoparticles added, a yearlong mesocosm experiment was conducted comparing a one-time pulse addition of pristine silver nanoparticles (Pulse Ag0NPs) to chronic low-concentration additions of either pristine (Chronic Ag0-NPs) or weathered (Chronic Ag2S-NPs) silver nanoparticles. The microcosm study suggested the underlying mechanism under high concentration exposures was methane production fueled by the release of DOC released by submersed vegetation. The mesocosm study showed that, while the Pulse Ag0-NP treatment had a rapid increase in methane concentration in the first week, the magnitude decreased over time converging with controls within a week. While the chronic treatments had no initial increase in methane, they did significantly increase relative to controls during weeks 28-34 and 42-45 in the Chronic Ag0-NPs treatment, and during weeks 28-30 and 42 in the Chronic Ag2S-NPs treatment, suggesting that even chronic addition of weathered particles could cause an increase in methane. Additionally, we observed that when methane concentrations were higher in chronic exposures, there is evidence of a shift in zooplankton abundance and composition that may have led to a trophic cascade wherein increased grazing by zooplankton depleted the abundance of methane-consuming microbes leading to elevated methane fluxes. In total, these studies show evidence of direct effects of contaminants on methane fluxes and provide evidence supporting potential indirect effects that may exacerbate the underlying direct effects."7/14/18 9:53,Christina,H,Eggensperger,ceggensperger@mtech.edu,Montana Tech,(406) 531-9486,,"520 W Mercury, Butte, MT 59701 United States",Student,Yes,Yes,Oral Presentation,Yes,Katherine,,Zodrow,Montana Tech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Living Filtration Membranes,"Membrane filtration has become a more prevalent form of water purification due to its ability to remove contaminants of concern from various types of dirty water.

Terrestrial hot springs have been found to be ideal habitats for deeply branching microbes, implying the presence of all 4 requirements for life. Many lines of evidence even point to the origin of life in a hydrothermal system (Martin et al., 2008; 2014), suggesting that hot springs may be the archetypal clement conditions. Much progress has been made in recent years characterizing the energy availability in such systems (i.e. Shock et al., 2010). The availability of trace nutrients such as metals, however, is an area of active research. This study characterizes the trace element composition and speciation in two major hydrothermal fields to establish the range of compositions and bioavailability in hot spring ecosystems. The abundance and speciation of trace elements dictate bioavailability to microbes which take up these metals for enzyme active sites. Terrestrial hot springs are the surface expression of hydrothermal systems that originate deep in Earthâ€™s crust. Trace element abundance can vary by more than 5 orders of magnitude. The extreme variability in geochemical compositions observed in such systems is a result of deep water-rock reaction, near-surface groundwater mixing, and surface input. The composition of these hydrothermal fluids is therefore heavily influenced by the host rock. The igneous regions that host hydrothermal systems range from basaltic to rhyolitic end members, differentiated primarily by silica and cation content that results from where the rocks were formed. The seafloor is typically basaltic, whereas continental crust is rhyolitic. Andesite, an intermediate composition, can be produced in subduction zones, where basalt from the seafloor is subducted under continental rhyolite. Together, these three rock types are the most prevalent hosts for hydrothermal systems. Samples were collected from dozens of hot springs in both the Ecuadorian Andes and Yellowstone National Park. The geochemical composition of each location was characterized for hundreds of components, including trace elements. The Ecuadorian Andes are primarily Andesitic in composition, with volcanic activity providing the heat source for hydrothermal systems. These hot springs are typically circumneutral, with significant concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved CO2 providing a buffer. Apparent iron and arsenic staining is present at many locations. Results from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) indicate many locations have abundant As, Fe, B, and Mo, but are typically lacking in Zn and Al relative to YNP hot springs. Yellowstone National Park host rock is primarily composed of rhyolite, the result of a continental hotspot supervolcano. The pH is highly variable, from <2 to >9. Trace metal abundances vary to a larger extent than in Ecuadorian springs as a result of this large variability in pH. By comparing these two hydrothermal regions, trends in trace element abundance and speciation emerge that inform how microbial communities may respond to trace nutrient limitation or abundance."7/17/18 18:48,John,,Lunzer,jlunzer@mtech.edu,Montana Tech of the University of Montana,(206) 227-8545,,"1018 Waukesha Street, Butte, MT 59701 United States",Student,No,No,Poster,Yes,Glenn,,Shaw,Montana Tech of the University of Montana,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Using groundwater modeling to assess groundwater and stream connectivity in a river restoration application,"Historic placer mining tailings along the Middle Fork John Day River north of Galena, Oregon force the current river channel to remain straight with limited structure.

Speciation calculations to date show that Ba2+, CuO (aq), and HAsO42- dominate at all locations. Calculations revealed that Ba2+ accounts for nearly 100% of the barium species at all sites. Copper speciation is likely pH dominated. In USBC (7.86 +/- 0.01), CuO (aq) occupied 53% of total dissolved copper. Calculations predicted 74% CuO (aq) for Slag Canyon (pH 8.08+/- 0.005) and 48% CuO (aq) for Santa (7.88+/- 0.05).

After a hot, dry summer in 2017, record-breaking snowfall through the winter and spring led to high snowmelt runoff and flooding across the state. Flooding started in April 2018 along the Montana Hi-Line. Provisional streamflow data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) indicate the peak flow at the Milk River near Saco might have tied for the second highest on record at that gage (USGS streamgage 06164510; 40 years of record), and was associated with an Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) between 10 percent and 4 percent (AEP calculated on 34 years of record, through 2011). Flooding shifted to the Clark Fork and Yellowstone River basins in May. Provisional streamflow data indicate peak flow at the Clark Fork above Missoula might have been the second highest on record at that gage (USGS streamgage 12340500; 98 years) and was associated with an AEP between 4 percent and 2 percent (AEP calculated on 97 years of record, through 2016). Peak flow at the Yellowstone River near Livingston might have been the third highest on record at that gage (USGS gaging station 06192500; 93 years) and was associated with an AEP between 2 percent and 1 percent (AEP calculated on 91 years of record, through 2015).

The water provided by the mountain-headwater geomorphic process domain is often critical to human infrastructure that typically dominates the intermountain-basin geomorphic process domain, and transitions between these process domains create characteristic patterns of exchange among streams, irrigation canals, soil water, and groundwater. We suggest that these predictable patterns provide a useful conceptual model for understanding drivers of water quality and the spatiotemporal distribution of recharge necessary to sustain groundwater use and stream flow generation during dry periods. We further suggest that understanding the mechanisms driving exchanges between surface and subsurface water resources within each process domain will be critical for predicting how a changing climate will influence the coupled human-natural systems of the west.Here, we explore the spatiotemporal distribution of surface-subsurface exchange along transects in the Gallatin River Watershed based on longitudinal synoptic perspectives on water quality. These transects include a mountain-headwater geomorphic process domain (Hyalite Canyon) and its mountain front transition to an intermountain-basin geomorphic process domain (Gallatin Valley). In Hyalite Canyon, we use strontium and uranium concentrations and their isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr and 234U/238U) as indicators of water-rock interaction to evaluate stream flow generation from aquifers associated with differing lithologic units along the canyon. We apply repeated end-member mixing analyses to evaluate the cumulative evolution of stream flow and water quality. Also in Hyalite Canyon, we compare longitudinal patterns of d18O and d2H in precipitation, snowpack, and stream water to infer seasonal patterns in connectivity between stream flow generation and precipitation or snowmelt. Comparisons of elevational patterns in the isotopic composition of precipitation and the snowpack appear to help discriminate between groundwater and precipitation sources of stream flow. Finally, exploration of patterns in strontium and uranium solutes are extended from Hyalite Canyon into the Gallatin Valley, where concentrations and isotopic ratios appear to homogenize from the mountain front to the watershed outlet. We suggest this homogenization reflects increasing contributions from an alluvial groundwater reservoir that is a well-mixed combination of recharge sources along the mountain front, and is also subject to further evolution in water quality driven by human infrastructure.Hydrologic concerns in the west are driving a transition from understanding the processes that drive floods to understanding the processes that provide sustainable water resources. Most conventional watershed hydrologic models were designed to predict the response of watersheds to precipitation, and thus their ability to predict low flow in dry seasons is often suspect. More spatially explicit studies of surface-subsurface exchanges, such as those presented here, will allow development and parameterization of a new generation of watershed-scale hydrologic models that incorporate the groundwater dynamics necessary to understand reliability of dry season stream flows under future climate conditions."7/26/18 15:23,Robert,,Ray,rray@mt.gov,Montana Department of Environmental Quality,(406) 444-5319,,"PO Box 200901, 1520 East Sixth Avenue, Helena, MT 59601 USA",Non-Student,Yes,No,Oral Presentation,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nonpoint Source Total Maximum Daily Load Implementation  - Example Watershed-Scale Evaluations,"Montana state law requires evaluation of completed TMDLs and attainment of water quality standards.

The Arctic Grayling (Thymallus Arcticus) is a population of fish that has seen the impact that cutting off upstream habitat has on the life cycle of a species.  A species once abundant in the rivers and lakes of Michigan and Montana, the Arctic Grayling now resides only in the Big Hole River watershed.  To help preserve the Arctic Grayling, 63 Denil fishways have been installed on irrigation diversion structures throughout this watershed.  However, this style of fish ladder requires higher flow levels to facilitate passage, but irrigators need every bit of water they can get. In an attempt to meet the need of Arctic grayling and irrigators, a study was conducted to test the efficacy of flow-control weirs (â€œflow-restrictor platesâ€ù) installed at the upstream end of the Denil fishway to decrease the required flowrate needed to pass Arctic grayling. This study investigated three distinct restrictor plate designs in addition to a control (no plate installed).  Each treatment received the same five trials in order to better compare flow restriction, passage efficiency, and several other hydraulic and ecologic factors.  Upon the completion of the data collection phase, analysis was done to assess the efficacy of installing any of these plates to the upstream end of the Denil fishway.  The end goal was to develop a model that could predict passage efficiency in a Denil fishway for a given plate based on a set of other variables.  After several iterations, it was found that the sole predictor of passage efficiency will be the amount of water running through the fish ladder. Work will continue to develop a standard for the installation of these flow control weirs, but at this time, it appears that these plates may in fact inhibit passage."
