We demonstrate that the 2017 U.S. Northern Great Plains (NGP) flash drought was preceded by a breakdown of land-atmosphere coupling. Severe drought conditions in the NGP were first identified by drought monitors in late May 2017 and rapidly progressed to exceptional drought in July. The likelihood of convective precipitation in May 2017 in northeastern Montana, however, resembled that of a typical August when rain is unlikely. Based on the lower tropospheric humidity index, convective rain was suppressed by the atmosphere on nearly 50% of days during March in NE Montana and central North Dakota, compared to 30% during a normal year. Micrometeorological variables, including potential evapotranspiration, were neither anomalously high nor low before the onset of drought. Incorporating convective likelihood to drought forecasts would have noted that convective precipitation in the NGP was anomalously unlikely during the early growing season of 2017. It may therefore be useful to do so in regions that rely on convective precipitation."

This aquifer, located beneath the Big Sky Golf Course, is the source for five municipal wells that provide water for the Big Sky Water and Sewer District, the primary public water supply for the resort. To construct the model, extensive groundwater and surface water data were collected from 2013-2016.  Drilling defined the geometry of the shale that underlies the alluvial aquifer. Groundwater elevations, stream flow and stage monitoring of the West Fork Gallatin River, local weather station data, well pumping volumes, and golf course irrigation data provided information to develop the conceptual model. Groundwater modeling has yielded a more refined understanding of the geometry of the aquifer and its interaction with the West Fork Gallatin River. The models will be useful for water conservation, projecting the effects of increased demands from the aquifer, and guiding management efforts at Big Sky Resort."

One common objective of this type of restoration is to increase seasonal water storage, which will in turn increase late-summer stream flows. However, the specific hydrologic mechanisms by which BMR would promote higher late summer flows remain poorly understood.We used GMS and MODFLOW to develop relatively simple numerical models of groundwater and surface water exchanges in fluvial systems, and assessed the magnitude and timing of changes in dynamic seasonal storage and stream flow resulting from BMR. Models were loosely based on headwater streams with a snowmelt-driven hydrograph and a valley gradient of about 0.005. Baseline models were developed for three different groundwater connection scenarios, where the simulated reach was gaining, losing, or strongly losing.  A control and five types of BMR treatments were simulated in each setting, including:  (1) no BMR, (2) creating a pond in the active channel, (3) activating a  proximal and a (4) distal remnant side-channel, (5) inundating the flood plain, and (6) creating surface water storage ponds connected to the channel only by groundwater flow paths. Thus, a total 18 of models were developed and used to calculate differences in net late-summer stream gains before and after restoration. Finally, sensitivity analyses using the baseline and distal channel reactivation scenarios in the gaining, losing and strongly losing settings evaluated the effects of substrate composition and evapotranspiration on the late-summer stream flow changes created by BMR.Active-channel ponds caused calculated late-summer net stream gains to increase by 0.06 Ls-1 (0.9 gpm) for the gaining stream, to increase by 0.07 Ls-1 (1.1 gpm) for the losing stream, and to decrease by 0.02 Ls-1 (0.3 gpm) for the strongly losing stream. Additional effects from activating remnant side-channels, or inundating the floodplain during high flows were modest, with the greatest gain being 0.01 Ls-1 (0.2 gpm) more than from the pond alone. Creating surface-water storage was more effective at increasing late-summer flows, with net stream gains increasing from 0.35 to 0.50 Ls-1 (5 to 8 gpm) above baseline. It should be noted that while these changes are calculable, they would be difficult to measure.Sensitivity analysis showed that aquifers composed of silty sand to coarse sand provided the best conditions for increasing late-summer flows. Similarly, stream beds composed of silty sand to sand provided for the greatest increase in late-summer flows. Simulation of evapotranspiration effects showed that the increase in groundwater table elevations (increased storage) created by BMR may allow more subsurface water to be used by riparian plants, potentially resulting in slight reductions in late-summer stream flow.In general, modeled scenarios suggest that BMR designs that recharge the aquifer farther from the channel lead to more seasonal storage. Creating seasonal storage in ponds that are connected to the main channel only through the subsurface strongly increases the potential for dynamic seasonal storage."

Recently, water users have taken a different approach to decades-old water management practices by petitioning to enforce a watershed-wide Temporary Preliminary Water Court Decree.  Set by laws as old as the state of Montana, water rights are distributed according to the prior appropriation doctrine.  A change in the distribution of water by priority along the 160-mile Teton River required a new understanding of how the river functions.Hydrologists, water commissioners, and water users are working together to overcome distribution challenges along the Teton River and its tributaries. Part of the solution includes new water planning tools that provide flexibility in a rigid legal system.  The result is a distribution project that is rooted in law but uses science and data to help manage water resources as efficiently as possible according to prior appropriation."
